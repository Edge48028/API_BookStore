<h1>Web API .NET Core 6</h1>

<p>It's a versatile ASP.NET Core 6 application with integrated authentication and authorization, user account management, and book information management. The application uses Entity Framework Core to connect and manage a SQL Server database.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>

<h3>Authentication and Authorization</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Integrated authentication and authorization using Identity Framework and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for security.</li>
    <li>User account management with registration and login capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Role Management</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Implements role-based authorization with two main roles: "User" and "Admin."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Book Management (Books)</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Provides API for basic operations on book information, including create, update, list, view details, and delete. These operations require "Admin" role permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Auto-Mapping with AutoMapper</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Utilizes the AutoMapper library to map between Data Transfer Object (DTO) objects and database objects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repository</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Creates a repository (IBookRepository) to abstract database operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customized Swagger</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Integrates Swagger to automatically generate API documentation and provide a user-friendly interface for API testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Display Roles on Swagger UI</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Customizes the Swagger interface to display the roles of logged-in users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Customizes the API to provide informative error messages when users attempt unauthorized actions due to permissions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Open the project in Visual Studio or your favorite code editor.</li>
    <li>Install NuGet packages by running the `dotnet restore` command in the project's root folder.</li>
    <li>Set up the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file and run the SQL Server database.</li>
    <li>Run the project and test the API through the Swagger interface.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Improvement and Development</h2>

<p>
    With the foundation in place, you can develop the application further according to your needs. Here are some ideas:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add additional features for book management, such as searching, sorting, and filtering.</li>
    <li>Enhance security integration by adding two-factor authentication (2FA) or JWT-based authentication.</li>
</ul>
